# Writing a naive linear regression in Python

## Prerequisites

Before reading this tutorial, you should know a bit of Python. If you
would like to refresh your memory, take a look at the
:doc:`Python tutorial <python:tutorial/index>`.  You should know how
to start Python, how to use the `print()` function, and how to import
a library, but otherwise we hope this tutorial will be fairly
self-explanatory.

If you want to be able to run the examples in this tutorial, you should also
have `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ available to the version of Python
you will be using.

## Learner profile

This tutorial is for people who have are jsut getting started with NumPy.  It
presumes very little prior knowledge.  Its intent is to provide an introduction
to basic NumPy functions using a concrete example.  It should be considered
a supplement to more systematic NumPy tutorials, but it should be accessible
before or after you use one of those.
